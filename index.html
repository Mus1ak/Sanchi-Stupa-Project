                        <p>The Great Stupa at Sanchi has been the focal point of the Buddhist faith in the region since
                            it was built by Emperor Ashoka in the 3rd century BC. The grand structure still inspires awe
                            today and sits at the top of a hill, surrounded by the remains of smaller stupas,
                            monasteries, and temples that were built as the religious community grew in the centuries
                            after the site was founded.</p>
